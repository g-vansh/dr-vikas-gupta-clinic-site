# Dr. Vikas Gupta Skin Care Clinic - Image Assets

This directory contains all the images used on the website. Below are the images that need to be added:

## Required Images

### 1. Dr. Vikas Gupta Photos
- **dr-vikas-gupta.jpg** (150x150px) - Main doctor photo for hero section
- **dr-vikas-gupta-profile.jpg** (300x400px) - Professional headshot for about page

### 2. Clinic Photos (Optional)
- **clinic-exterior.jpg** - Exterior view of the clinic
- **clinic-interior.jpg** - Interior/waiting area of the clinic
- **consultation-room.jpg** - Doctor's consultation room

### 3. Medical Icons/Graphics (Using Unicode/CSS instead)
- Using emoji and CSS icons for:
  - Medical symbols (üè•, üíä, üéØ, etc.)
  - Star ratings (‚≠ê)
  - Contact icons (üìû, üìç, etc.)

## Image Guidelines
- Format: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Optimization: Compress images for web (under 500KB each)
- Responsive: Provide high-resolution images that scale well
- Alt text: All images must have descriptive alt attributes

## Fallback Images
If actual photos are not available, the website will work with:
- Default placeholder backgrounds
- CSS-generated icons and symbols
- Professional medical stock images (ensure licensing)

## Implementation Notes
- Images are referenced in HTML with proper alt text
- CSS handles responsive scaling
- Lazy loading is implemented for performance
- Images support both light and professional medical aesthetic

## Missing Images Handling
The website is designed to work gracefully without images:
- Text content is comprehensive and standalone
- Color scheme and typography carry the professional appearance
- Icons and symbols are CSS/Unicode based
- Layout doesn't break if images are missing
