# Golden Accolade Visibility Fix

## Problem
The golden accolade text ("Ranked #1 Dermatologist in Moradabad by Local Benchmarks") was not visible on mobile devices and was getting cut off on desktop due to insufficient spacing at the top of the hero section.

## Root Cause
- The golden accolade was positioned too close to the top edge with `top: 20px` on desktop
- On mobile devices (768px and below), it was positioned at `top: 10px` 
- On very small mobile devices (480px and below), it was positioned at `top: 5px`
- The hero section padding wasn't providing enough space for the accolade to be fully visible

## Solution
Made the following changes to `assets/css/style.css`:

### 1. Increased Hero Section Top Padding
**Desktop:**
- Changed from `padding: 140px 0 80px` to `padding: 160px 0 80px`
- Added 20px more top padding to create space for the accolade

**Mobile (768px and below):**
- Changed from `padding: 120px 0 60px` to `padding: 140px 0 60px`
- Added 20px more top padding for mobile devices

### 2. Moved Golden Accolade Lower
**Desktop:**
- Changed from `top: 20px` to `top: 40px`
- Moved the accolade 20px lower from the top edge

**Mobile (768px and below):**
- Changed from `top: 10px` to `top: 25px`
- Moved the accolade 15px lower for better visibility

**Small Mobile (480px and below):**
- Changed from `top: 5px` to `top: 15px`
- Moved the accolade 10px lower for very small screens

## Result
- The golden accolade is now fully visible on all device sizes
- The hero content has been pushed down appropriately to maintain visual balance
- The accolade no longer gets cut off by the browser edge or overlaps with the header
- Responsive design maintains proper spacing across all breakpoints

## Files Modified
- `assets/css/style.css` - Updated hero section padding and golden accolade positioning

## Testing
The changes ensure the golden accolade is visible and properly positioned on:
- Desktop screens (1200px+)
- Tablet screens (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile phones (480px - 767px)
- Small mobile phones (< 480px)
